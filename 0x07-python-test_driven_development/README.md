# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

Procedure followed to write tests:
- Write test that'll fail
- Then write the program code
- Then test your program with the failing test to see if it will actually fail
- Then write correct tests
- Then test your code
- Then write more codes
- Then write more tests

The main thing here is that test driven development eradicates fear of making mistakes while coding. You should also start by writing failing tests before writing correct test. Run the test code as you continue to write your application.
